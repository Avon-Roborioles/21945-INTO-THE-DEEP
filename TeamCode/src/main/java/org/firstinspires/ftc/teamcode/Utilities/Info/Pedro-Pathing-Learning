1) Pedro Pathing General Overview
https://youtu.be/HI7eyLLpCgM?si=k9-jPhOipYutlmta
    - Pedro Pathing is reactive as it can adjust on the fly compared to RoadRunner
    - Paths are made with Bezier Curves (easy to change and get position from)
    - Can constantly adjust heading on the fly (saves time)
    - Paths are made with 4 Vectors in mind (centripetal, translational, heading, drive)
    - Pedro-Pathing has the ability to actively hold positions on the fields (highly resistant to bumps/collisions)
    - Can also use TeleOp Enhancements to reduce centripetal force
